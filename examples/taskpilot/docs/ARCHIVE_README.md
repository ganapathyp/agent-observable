# Archived Documentation

This directory contains archived/redundant documentation that has been consolidated into the library documentation or is no longer needed.

## Why Archived?

These docs were:
1. **Redundant** - Information moved to library docs (`libraries/agent-observable-core/docs/`)
2. **Temporary** - Fix documentation that's been applied
3. **Superseded** - Replaced by newer, consolidated documentation

## Where to Find Current Docs

- **Library docs:** `libraries/agent-observable-core/docs/`
- **Current TaskPilot docs:** `docs/` (parent directory)
- **Root project docs:** `docs/` (at monorepo root)
